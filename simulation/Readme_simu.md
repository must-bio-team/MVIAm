**This is the simulation code.**

**Simulate_data.m:** It is used to generate simualtion data.  

**Simulation_aggregate.R:** It is used to aggregate multiple simulation data to a large aggregated data.  

**Simu_LR.R:** This code is using logistic regression model with penalty function (Lasso, Elastic net et al.).  

**Simu_SPL.R** This code is based on Self-Paced Learning using logistic regression model with penalty function (Lasso, Elastic net et al.).  

**Simu_MVSPL.R** This code is based on Multi-view Self-Paced Learning using logistic regression model with penalty function (Lasso, Elastic net et al.).
